		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>To save her father from death in the army, a young maiden secretly goes in his place 
			and becomes one of China's greatest heroines in the process.</p>

			<h2>Meet the characters</h2>

			<h3>Mulan</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan.jpeg" alt="" width="200"/>
			<p>Mulan is always thinking about others over herself, which is clear from the start 
				when she takes her father's place in the army, literally putting her life on the 
				line for him. She grows in confidence throughout the movie and really begins to 
				believe in her own talents and abilities. The fact she trains and takes it seriously 
				to become the best warrior showcases her dedication.</p>

			<h3>Li Shang</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Li_Shang.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Li Shang is the man in charge of the army in Mulan, and because his father is the 
				army general he is desperate to impress. Li Shang takes his role seriously because 
				of that, and at first, he is perhaps a little too strict on the others, but it does 
				allow him to train them into shape.</p>

			<h3>Chien Po</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Chien_Po.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Out of everybody that ends up in the army, Chien Po is by far the nicest, as he is always 
				thinking of other people before himself and would much prefer to talk things out rather 
				than fight about any differences. He is kind to Mulan from the start, which isn't the case 
				with all of the characters, and the fact that he hates violence is also a very likable trait.</p>

			<h3>Mushu</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Mushu.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>When it comes to Disney sidekicks, Mushu is one of the very best. He's a hilarious character that 
				is full of personality and charisma, which creates a lot of really funny moments throughout the 
				movie with his great one-liners and witty comebacks. While Mushu can be a little bossy and sometimes 
				gives Mulan poor advice, he does ultimately want what is best for her.</p>

			<h3>Crikee</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Crikee.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Cri-Kee is along for the journey as a lucky cricket to help protect Mulan, and while he doesn't do anything 
				of note to do that, she does stay alive. He's a classic Disney sidekick character who is always looking out 
				for the main hero, doing whatever is needed throughout the movie.</p>

			<h3>Ling</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Ling.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Ling is another of the soldiers that Mulan gets close with, and he is the funniest of the trio. Ling is the 
				real joker of the pack, and that allows him to stand out and seem very likable, as he is always trying to 
				cheer other people up.</p>

			<h3>Yao</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Yao.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Yao is one of three soldiers that Mulan ends up becoming good friends with during the movie, although Yao 
				is one who makes her life difficult at the start. Early on he is a bully and likes to get into fights simply 
				for the sake of it, wanting to show he's the toughest man around.</p>

			<h3>Fa Zhou</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Fa_Zhou.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Mulan's father, Fa Zhou, already fought his war and represented his country, however, when he's called up Fa Zhou 
				has no problem in stepping up and doing it again. Despite the fact he struggles to walk and knows the likely consequences 
				that would come with him going to war again, it's something he is going to do until Mulan steps in.</p>

			<h3>Chi Fu</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Chi_Fu.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Chi Fu is the Emperor of China's advisor.  He's clearly someone who is very loyal and trustworthy. he is a very judgemental 
				person who doesn't really treat Li Shang with any respect, despite the fact he's technically in charge.</p>

			<h3>Shen Yu</h3>
			<img src="images/Mulan_Shan_Yu.jpeg" alt="" width="200px"/>
			<p>Shan Yu is simply evil, as the leader of the Hun army, he is set on taking over China and taking down the Emperor at all costs.</p>
