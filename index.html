		<p>Disney has been creating some of the best content for kids 
			and adults for decades. I've grown up watching these movies
		and have loved every single one of them. The stories have provided 
		themes for people of all ages with a splash of tons of music 
		and a bit of magic!</p>

		
		<p>These are some of my favourite movies so far that have represented 
			strong, independent women from different cultures and had been 
			even now an inspiration for many young girls and adults!</p>
